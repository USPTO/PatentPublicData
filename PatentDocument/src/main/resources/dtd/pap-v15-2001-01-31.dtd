<!-- ***** START REVISION HISTORY *****

Pending Issues/Comments:
1) The PAP sample data includes a hard coded reference to the DTD using a full path. Need to
...explore using a URI/URL.

2001-01-31
1) Removed pending issue comment concerning EFS utilizing spanspec. EFS currently does not use
   spanspec.
2) Added external entity tbl.table.att overriding the default CALSxml DTD values to allow for a
   portrait or landscape orientation definition within tables, and tabstyle to identify monospace
   tables. Also added comments highlighting the fact that overrides are being used.
3) Corrected attribute name of element division-of (from st332-name to st32-name).
4) External entity contents were un-commented and the doctype statement was commented for
   distribution. This is the format used in production to parse document instances. Prior
   releases may have been in the "nf" form (Near&Far) to quickly parse and view the DTD.
5) Since tables within tables are not supported, modified the CALS table paracon external entity
   to exclude table-cwu.
6) Changed version to V1.5 and the build date to 2001-01-31.
7) Changed the DTD public identifier to "-//USPTO//DTD PAP V1.5 2001-01-31//EN"

2000-11-01
1) Made element chemistry optional
2) Changed the DTD public identifier to "-//USPTO//DTD PAP V1.4 2000-11-01//EN"

2000-09-13
1) Attribute id added to subdoc-drawings to allow figure references to point to the drawing section.
2) Changed version to V1.4 and build date to 2000-09-13.
3) Changed the paragraph levels to support 0-7 (identical to Grant Red Book)

2000-09-06
1) Changed version to V1.3 and build date to 2000-09-06.
2) Changed element usc371-date to optional since it will not be included on the published
   application cover page.
3) Added optional element military-address to the address element. The data capture contractor
   will extract the military address text from the address line text.
4) Modified the residence element to distinguish between US and non-US residences.

2000-08-22
1) Removed addition-to related application code.
2) Changed version to V1.2 and date to 2000-08-22.

2000-08-08
1) Changed the xml encoding from "ISO-8859-1" to "UTF-8"

2000-08-02
1) Moved the botanic model from the specification (in front of the background-of-invention) to
...the bibliographic (after the title-of-invention) section.
2) Within the patent application DTD, the sequence-cwu model was modified to include an object
...reference for patents with sequence listings that are not to be published. The sequence-cwu
...model changed:
...From: (number,(sequence-list-old-rules | sequence-list-new-rules | table),image*)
...To: (number,(sequence-list-old-rules | sequence-list-new-rules | table | object-reference),image*)
3) Moved element sequence-cwu to before subdoc-claims.
4) Added a-371-of-international to the patent application DTD (missing)
5) Added reissue-of to the patent application DTD (missing)
6) Renamed element "substitute-for" to "substitution-for" so it would match the EFS counterpart element.
7) Added footnote to the paragraph content model. Moved out of the external references.
8) Changed version to V1.1 and date to 2000-08-02.

2000-07-27
1) Removed attribute data-format-notation from elements email and telephone. No longer in the
...EFS source and value of "to_come_from_LM" was unresolved.
2) New plant patents rules require the latin name and variety per the UPOV international
...agreement. Added before the background-of-invention the new optional element botanic
...with the model (latin-name, variety) where latin-name and variety are both pcdata.

2000-07-18
1) Changed version to V1.0 and date to 2000-07-18.
2) Changed element object-reference content model to (object-description,object-id,object-contents)

... - Rename object to object-reference and include the ID attribute
... - Remove object-pto-id
5) Made heading within  federal-research-statement optional

2000-07-10
1) Changed version to V0.9 and date to 2000-07-11.
2) Sequence Listing - Changed occurrence of <s-2-vii-b> to OPTIONAL
3) Sequence Listing - Changed occurrence of <s-2-i-a> to OPTIONAL
4) Sequence Listing - Changed occurrence <s-2-x-a>, <s-2-x-b> to OPTIONAL

2000-06-26
1) Changed version to V0.8 and date to 2000-06-26.
2) Removed reference-number under name and element.
3) Address removed the label attribute
4) Added optional correspondence-address after assignee of subdoc-bibliographic-information. Used
...the bibliographic DTD model.
5) Removed section from the brief-description-of-sequences content model.

...and us-agency.
7) Removed the class/label attribute from the following elements:
....address-1
....address-2
....biological-deposit
....chemistry-cwu
....copyright-statement
....cross-reference
....dependent-claim-reference
....deposit-accession-number
....deposit-date
....deposit-description
....deposit-term
....depository
....drawing-reference-character

....highlight
....list-item
....math-cwu
....middle-name

...distribution as values (not fixed).
...The version attribute is the version number in the format of "[Electronic Version 0.7] ".
...The distribution attribute is the DTD distribution/build date in the form of "2000-06-22".
3) Removed element field-of-search. Does not belong.
4) Since elements a1, a2, and a9 are redundant with the kind code of the document id, they have
...been renoved. Model changed from (a1,a2*,a9*) to (document-id+).
5) Removed domestic-family and replaced with prior-publication.
6) Added element representative-figure.

2000-06-21
1) Changed occurrence of <S-2-VIII-A>, <S-2-VIII-B>, <S-2-VIII-C>,
                         <S-2-X-C>, <S-2-X-D>, <S-2-X-E>, <S-2-X-F> to OPTIONAL

2000-06-20
1) In the PGPUB meeting decided that the list-item content model does not need number and
...program-listing.

2000-06-16
1) Modified the lists content model in paragraphs to use the EFS list model. Since only the
...markush-group type list is within claims, it was not modified. Consequently the following
...elements were deleted:
......list-definitions
......term
......definition
......list-ordered
......list-simple
......list-unordered
......claim-item (Referenced only by definition, list-ordered, list-simple, and list-unordered.
..................This was a mis-named element since claims only supported the markush group.)
...The list-item element was added with the paragraph model excluding number and program-listing:
......(#PCDATA | biological-deposit-citation | citation | chemistry-cwu | cross-reference
...............| custom-character | highlight |in-line-formula | lists | math-cwu | table-cwu)*
...And the lists element content model was changed:
......from: (list-definitions | list-ordered | list-simple | list-unordered)
........to: (list-item+)
