********** REVISION HISTORY **********
2001-10-03
 1) Modified element CLREF from EMPTY to PDAT.

2001-09-25
 1) Element B800 content model changed back to (B860,B870?). Multiple PCT references are only allowed
    within related application data.

2001-09-18
 1) Deleted B863 & B864 and replaced with optional B864US for the 371 (c)(1)(2)(4) PCT date.
 2) B645 is now used for reexaminations requested by the  applicant, assignee, or commissioner.
 3) Added element B646US for reexamination requested by a 3rd party.

2001-09-04
 1) Modified CALS table references to use the default CALS-xml DTD. Table elements and attributes
    are now lower case and both Grant and Application Red Book (XML) use the same table and math
    DTDs. The CALSxmlUC DTD overrides (#7 in the 2001-07-11 updates) have been removed. In addition
    the content model for TABLE-CALS changed from (TABLE) to (table), and the content model for
    SEQLST-US changed from (SEQ-LST-OLD | SEQ-LST-NEW | TABLE) to (SEQ-LST-OLD | SEQ-LST-NEW | table).
 2) Entity references have been consolidated into a single entity declaration. File ST32-US-Grant-025xml.ent
    must be local (in the same directory) to this DTD and contain the DTD's list of entity references.

2001-07-18
 1) Sequence listing elements S-2-IX-D content model replaced with (STEXT+).
 2) Removed attribute FILE from element PATDOC.
 3) Element B800 content model changed to (B860+,B870?) to allow for multiple PCT.
 4) SEQLST-US content model removed the EMI* reference.
 5) Changed element references of TABLE to table to comply with the mathml dtd. Elements TABLE-CALS
    and SEQLST-US were impacted.

2001-07-11 Converted the DTD to XML
 1) Modified PUBLIC identifier to: "-//USPTO//DTD ST.32 US PATENT GRANT V2.5 XML 2002-01-01//EN"
 2) Modified the contact information and added the xml processing instruction.
 3) Removed all element minimization parameters (- -,o -,- o,o o)
 4) Modified the dtd to utilize the patent application publication entity and notation
    references, as well as the cals-xml and original mathml DTDs.
 5) Element S-2 attribute SEQ-NO changed from NUMBER to CDATA.
 6) Changed element references of MATH to math to comply with the mathml dtd. Elements F and
    MATHML were impacted. In SGML elements are case insensitive, and in the production data the
    lower case math element tag mapped to the MATH element. However in xml the elements and
    attributes are case sensitive. Since the data was already lower case, the DTD was modified
    to conform to the data.
 7) Case sensitivity problems existed with all of the table elements and attributes. Consequently
    a new upper case cals xml dtd was created (CALSxmlUC.dtd) and this dtd was modified to
    reference it. Entities YESORNO, PARACON, TITLES, and TBL.TABLE.ATT were also modified for
    upper case (in this DTD).
 8) The DTD was modified to reference the local entity file ST32-US-Grant-025xml.ent which contains
    the external file entity declarations. The DTD no longer needs to be modified for entity file path
    changes, and no longer has any hard-coded path information.

2001-07-10
 1) Modified PUBLIC identifier to: "-//USPTO//DTD ST.32 US PATENT GRANT V2.5 2002-01-01//EN"
 2) Kind code changes effective 2001-01-02 to accommodate pre-grant publication status (B130)
    required a comment change in the dtd.
 3) CHEM-US and MATH-US content mode changed from EMI* to EMI?. A single image file is provided.
    The file however may be a multi-page tiff image.
 4) Modified the following elements to include an ALT attribute for compliance to
    section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998:
	CHEMCDX           with default value "chemistry chemdraw file"
	CHEMMOL           with default value "chemistry mol file"
	CUSTOM-CHARACTER  with default value "custom character"
	EMI               with default value "embedded image"
	MATHEMATICA       with default value "mathematica file"
	RTI               with default value "replaced text with image"
 5) Changed the attribute sequence of CUSTOM-CHARACTER to conform to the sequence used by the
    other file link elements.
 6) Modified sequence listing element S-2-VI-A (organism) to be optional.
 7) Re-added attributes HE, WI, LX, and LY to elements CUSTOM-CHARACTER, RTI, and EMI. They had
    been removed in version V2.3 with the assumption that the information could be extracted
    from the TIFF header. The attribute sequence may have changed from V2.2.
 8) Added element B690US (prior publication) to related applications. Multiple B690US elements
    may exist.
 9) Added optional attribute LANG to element DOC.
10) Element B864 is now optional.

2000-09-20
1) Modified PUBLIC identifier to: "-//USPTO//DTD ST.32 US PATENT GRANT V2.4 2000-09-20//EN"
2) Changed optional element LEGAL-REPRESENTATIVE of B721 (inventor) to zero or more.
3) Added alias comment to DTD description.

2000-08-28
1) Modified PUBLIC identifier to: "-//USPTO//DTD ST.32 US PATENT GRANT V2.3 2000-09-08//EN"
2) Made element B863 (35 USC 371 (PCT) date) optional since it no longer being captured within
   Application Red Book.
3) Modified B561 (Citing a patent document) and B562 (Citing non-patent literature) to include
   optional elements CITED-BY-EXAMINER and CITED-BY-OTHER.
4) In the B500 model (Technical information), added optional element BOTANIC after B540
   (Title of Invention). Element BOTANIC is required for all Plant patents within Application Red
   Book, and will eventually be populated within Grant Red Book.
5) Element B222US content model changed from EMPTY to PDAT to allow for the inclusion of the
   notice text.
6) Comments for elements B561 (Citing a patent document) and B562 (Citing non-patent literature)
   were modified to clarify usage.
7) Added optional element LEGAL-REPRESENTATIVE to B721 (inventor). It contains a PARTY-US element
   with DTXT containing the text identifying the type of legal representative such as:
       legal representative
       executor
       executrix
       heir
       heiress
       adminsitrator
       administratrix
   Element LEGAL-REPRESENTATIVE is used when the inventor is deceased or incapacitated. If deceased,
   DTXT within the inventor party-US element will contain the "deceased" text.
8) Comments were added to name elements TTL, SFX, IID, and IRF indicating that they are reserved for
   future use. These elements are not used even if appropriate content exists within the first name
   (FNM) or sir name (SNM).
9) Comments were added to address elements CNTY, EAD, TEL, and FAX indicating that they are reserved
   for future use. These elements are not used even if appropriate content exists within one of the
   other address elements.
10)Removed the optional TIFF image reference (EMI) from the table CWU. The data capture contractor
   does not create TIFF images for tables.
11)Removed attributes HE, WI, LX, LY, and TI from element EMI. HE, WI, LX, and LY information should be
   extracted from the TIFF header. TI is not initialized and the ST32 definitions are unclear.
12)Removed attributes HE, WI, LX, and LY from element CUSTOM-CHARACTER and RTI. This information
   should be extracted from the TIFF header.
13)Removed attribute option ST33 (leaving just TIFF) from the IMF attribute of elements EMI and RTI.
14)Added attribute TYPE to element EMI with values CCITG4 (default) and HALFTONE. CCITG4 indicates
   that the image is 400dpi with CCITG4 compression. HALFTONE indicates that the image is a 100dpi
   grayscale image with LZW compression.
15)Modified element NCIT to include optional DOC for patent applications. Since the existing data
   capture procedures have not changed, patent application citation information will continue to be
   included as text within STEXT. This change is intented to allow implementation when the data
   capture procedures change.
16)Added INID codes as an element attribute where appropriate. Impacted elements are:
   [10] B100 Document Identification
   [11] B110 Document Number
   [12] B130 Document Kind (Render in Descriptive Form)
   [45] B140 Document Date (publication or issue)
   [19] B190 Publishing Country or Organization (WIPO ST.3)
   [21] B210 Application Number For US Documents
   [22] B220 Application or PCT Filing Date
   [30] B300 Foreign Priority Data
   [51] B510 International Patent Classification (IPC) Data
   [52] B520 Domestic or National Classification Data
   [54] B540 Title of Invention
   [56] B560 Citations
   [57] B570 Abstract or Design Claim and Figure Description
   [58] B580 Field of Search
   [60] B600 Continuity Data/Prior Provisional Application
   [62] B620 Division of
   [63] B630 Continuation of
   [64] B640 Reissue of
   [66] B660 Document for which this is a substitute
   [73] B730 Assignee (grantee, assignee, holder, owner)
   [86] B860 PCT International Application Number
   [87] B870 PCT Publication Date/Number

2000-08-21
1) Modified PUBLIC identifier to: "-//USPTO//DTD ST.32 US PATENT GRANT V2.2 2000-08-21//EN"
2) Removed PBOX from ADR - It is included as part of STR per current data capture procedures.
3) Added element B597US to indicate if there is an exemplary drawing.
4) FGREF changed from EMPTY to PDAT.
5) Added attribute ID to element SDODR.
6) B570 content model changed from (B577,B578US*) to (B577,B578US+) since there will always
   be a an exemplary claim.
Note: SDT current data capture procedures only allows for 0 or 1 STR, even though the DTD uses STR*.

2000-4-13, All date fields defined as yyyymmdd
2000-4-13, RTIS notes that several required data fields are not being initialized. Let the parser
.....identify any additional DTD changes.
2000-4-12, RTIS recommends discarding element S-2-II-MT and creating the attribute
..... MOLECULE-TYPE on S-2-II. Not implemented. In Red Book attributes are used for retaining
..... unique identification or presentation information and not for data content. In addition
..... attribute information is not as easily searched within some search engines. Attributes
..... tend to hide the data.
2000-4-12, OPTI identifies redundant elements between "B" tags and this DTD content. These elements
..... reflect redundant information within Red Book, and since the "B" tags are already required,
..... the corresponding sequence listing tags (and data content) are to be deleted. The impacted
..... elements are:
.....
.....Old. Deleted....Original
.....New .Element....Element

..the publishing of patent documents. It was derived from version 3.4 of the
..WIPO Standard ST.32 DTD. The original DTD was modified to handle only those
..elements used by the USPTO. It incorporates the CALS table and equation
..models, and handles graphics as external entities. The last revision
